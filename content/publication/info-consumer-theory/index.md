abstract: "Classic comparisons---e.g. Blackwell efficiency---of information sources tell us little about tradeoffs between different sources, especially when they differ in cost. This paper seeks to fill that gap for finite-state environments by describing the consumer theory of information when information is cheap (or budgets large). I propose a generalized notion of precision---the negative-log of the efficiency index used by Moscarini and Smith (2002)---that measures how well an information source distinguishes two possible states. I then show that maximizing the precision of the worst-case state pair yields an approximation for information demand with percent error vanishing proportionally with costs. I further show iso-least-precision sets have finitely many kinks and are otherwise bowed *out*, and thus information demand exhibits vanishing substitution effects at almost all cost ratios. This kinked geometry additionally implies an upper bound on the number of information sources that will ever be used in non-vanishing proportions: at most as many as there are state pairs. Finally, because precision is independent of prior and payoffs, all decision-makers roughly agree on the optimal bundle. In sum, demand for information starkly deviates from the benchmark convex preferences model of standard consumer theory."
  

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "My job market paper examines a scenario where a decision-maker
trying to learn about an underlying state of the world must decide not
only *how much* information to purchase, but also *from which*
sources. I develop an approximate consumer theory for information, valid
when information purchases are large and the relevant probabilities are
well-described by large-deviations theory. I show that demand for information behaves as though preferences were kinked, and thus is poorly described by the benchmark smooth, convex preference model."
