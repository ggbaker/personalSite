abstract: "In many natural scenarios, a decision-maker facing
uncertainty must decide not only *how much* information to purchase, but
also *from which* sources. Unfortunately, an understanding of the value
of information for general information structures is notoriously
elusive.  I characterize tradeoffs between samples from different
sources in a setting with large information purchases where the
probability of a mistake is small and well-described by large deviations
theory. More specifically, in environments with finitely many possible
underlying states, I provide an approximation for the marginal rate of
substitution for samples from distinct information sources, valid when
samples are sufficiently cheap (or budgets sufficiently large).  I then
show marginal rate of substitution is given by a ratio of precision-like
indices that depend only on properties of each information source and
the relative proportions of each signal in the bundle. This formula
naturally implies a particularly accurate approximation for information
demand in constrained settings. Furthermore, because the precision of
each signal does not depend on decision-maker characteristics, all
decision-makers---independent of prior and payoff structure---agree on
the relative proportions of each source in an asymptotically optimal
bundle.  Of particular note: in environments with more than two possible
states, interior solutions arise when the signals differ in which pairs
of states they struggle to distinguish most. In this case, the
asymptotically optimal bundle either occurs at a corner or at one of a
finite number of interior kink points where the worst-case pair of
states switches.  To illustrate these results, I consider a number of
basic consumer theory exercises and discuss implications for information
demand."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "My job market paper examines a scenario where a decision-maker
trying to learn about an underlying state of the world must decide not
only *how much* information to purchase, but also *from which*
sources. I develop an approximate consumer theory for information, valid
when information purchases are large and the relevant probabilities are
well-described by large-deviations theory."
