abstract: "In many settings, a decision-maker facing uncertainty must
    decide not only *how much* information to purchase, but also *from
    which* sources.  It is already known that when uncertainty is about
    a binary variable---there are two possible “states of the world”---a
    decision-maker with a sufficiently large budget will spend their
    entire budget on signals from a single source: the most precise one.
    When there are more than two possible states of the world, however,
    the story is different: different information sources may differ in
    the pair of states they are worst at distinguishing, and the
    decision-maker may therefore purchase information from different
    sources which “cover for each others’ weaknesses.”  I characterize
    tradeoffs between samples from different sources in a setting with
    low costs (or large budgets), where the probability of a mistake is
    small and well-described by large deviations theory.  I show that,
    at large samples, the marginal rate of substitution samples from
    distinct information sources is approximately given by the ratio of
    precision-like indices for each source, and that the asymptotically
    optimal bundle satisfies a maxi-min rule: it maximizes the precision
    per dollar for the worst case pair of states.  Since the precision
    of each signal does not depend on the characteristics of the
    decision-maker (their prior beliefs or the payoffs of the decision
    problem they face), all decision-makers agree on the fraction of
    signals from each source in an asymptotically optimal
    bundle. Different information sources with the same worst-case pair
    of states---the two states the signal is least precisely able to
    differentiate---are redundant, and are never demanded together; the
    asymptotically optimal bundle occurs either at a corner, or at one
    of a finite number of interior “kink points” where the worst-case
    pair of states switches.  To illustrate these results, I consider a
    number of basic consumer theory exercises and discuss implications
    for information demand."
  

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "My job market paper examines a scenario where a decision-maker
trying to learn about an underlying state of the world must decide not
only *how much* information to purchase, but also *from which*
sources. I develop an approximate consumer theory for information, valid
when information purchases are large and the relevant probabilities are
well-described by large-deviations theory."
