abstract: "We consider the problem of a Bayesian researcher looking to
	optimally design an investigation into some unknown parameter of
	interest, when multiple data sources (or experimental designs), possibly
	differing in cost per sample, are available. Because expected losses are
	typically impractical to compute or simulate, we consider an approximate
	solution that holds for large sample sizes (so when the researcher's
	budget is large).  We show that the asymptotically optimal design uses
	data sources in proportions that maximize the Fisher information per
	dollar. Importantly, this criterion generically does not depend on the
	researcher's loss function, and thus is applicable in a wide variety of
	settings.  Our approach provides a basis for a Bayesian approach to
	experiment design that escapes many of the inflexibilities of the usual
	frequentist approach.  Specifically, we allow for comparisons of data
	sources that might have very disparate data generating processes, and
	thus would be difficult to compare under classical approaches. 
	Furthermore, our results directly account not only for the
	statistical properties of a data source, but also its cost per sample."
  

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this project, we generalize some of the results from my job
market paper to a Bayesian estimation setting and consider implications
for optimal experiment design. We show that the optimal design at large
samples generally maximizes the Fisher information per dollar for the
worst-case true value of the parameter of interest."
