I'm a dissertator in the [Department of Economics](https://econ.wisc.edu) at the University of
Wisconsin--Madison. I'm an economic theorist interested in information
economics and decision theory. My current research studies the demand
and valuation of information.  

I am currently on the job market and am available for remote
interviews by the usual means (Skype, Zoom, etc.) including during the
virtual [European Job
Market](https://www.europeanjobmarketofeconomists.org/ejm-2020/).
