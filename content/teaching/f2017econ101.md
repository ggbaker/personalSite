Welcome to my Econ 101 page for Fall 2017. Here I will post various updates throughout the semester for my students, as well as provide links to the weekly handouts as they become available. More detailed information on the course can be found on Professor Kelly's [webpage](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~ekelly/econ101/).

<h2>Updates</h2>

*10 September* - I've uploaded Handout 1 and its solutions. If some of the topics covered in section this week seem a bit unclear, feel free to email me or attend office hours, but also to solve some of the exercises not covered on the handout. Mathematical fluency will come with practice.
