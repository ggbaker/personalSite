Welcome to my Econ 101 page for Spring 2018. Here I will post various updates throughout the semester for my students, as well as provide links to the weekly handouts as they become available. More detailed information on the course can be found on Professor Kelly's [webpage](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~ekelly/econ101/).

<h2>Updates</h2>

*28 January* - I've uploaded Handout 1 and its solutions. If some of the topics covered in section this week seem a bit unclear, feel free to email me or attend office hours, but also to solve some of the exercises not covered on the handout. Mathematical fluency will come with practice.

*4 February* - Handout 2 has been uploaded. Don't forget that the first homework is due this Thursday at the start of lecture.

*18 February* - Handouts 3 and 4 uploaded. HW 2 is due this coming Thursday at the start of class, and the first midterm is one week from this Tuesday. More details will be sent via email later this week.

*21 March* - Apologies for the delay in updates on account of my recent illness. I've updated the handouts up to Handout 8.

*24 April* - Handouts updated through handout 12. Homework 5 is due Thursday, 3 May. We will not be able to return it before the final exam, so make sure you make a copy if you want it to study by.

*4 May* - Final handouts added. Good luck on the exam and have a good break!
